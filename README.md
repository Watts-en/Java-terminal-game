# Java-terminal-game
It is a simple java terminal game. I built it in order to practice my code skills that I obtained while I was learning Java.  

The game calls "Keyboard battle". You should click the given characters in order to win CPU. If you click correctly you will hit a cpu and decrease its xp. However, if you click incorrectly cpu will hit you and take random xp from 15 to 30. Moreover, if you take 3 correct answers you will get a new level and it will give you + 20 to your xp. So, enjoy the game.
